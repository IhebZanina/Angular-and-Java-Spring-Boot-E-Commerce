# Angular-and-Java-Spring-Boot-E-Commerce
Build a Full Stack E-Commerce website with Angular and Java Spring Boot (includes Stripe Credit Card Payments)

So my main objective here is to build a full stack application with Angular and Spring Boot. So I'll have `Angular` on the front end and `Spring Boot` on the back end, and they'll communicate with each other using a `REST API`. And then in the background I'll have a database and I'll have full CRUD support for the database. Next I'll pull all this together and I'll build a real-time `eCommerce` application.
